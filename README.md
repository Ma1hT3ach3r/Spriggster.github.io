#### Starting C#

<p>Starting C# was the first workshop I've ever done for coding outside of school! It brought me out of my comfort zone and dared me to  try new things! This was the gate way to C# and tought me the in's and out's of the langauge. All the basic variables and quirks of the system. As well as what I would be dealing with as I carried on through the lessons. This also tought me to be independant with my learning.</p>



#### Working With Classes

<p>Working with classes was the 4th module and 4th workshop I worked through. It taught me about static, public and private variables, in the context of a class. I also was taught how to affect the class within its self and from the main program. This was a huge change because of setting static variables I could focus on objecto oriented design instead. This dramaticly increased my interest in the workshop and has me looking forward to the next workshops comming up.</p>



#### Creating a small game in C#

<p>Creating a small game in C# was the 2nd workshop that I attended. It taught me about the all powerful void and those who dwell in it,  as well as if statements and loops. This was a exciting class that tested my ablities from the prior 1st workshop I did. I was also tasked at the end of the class to create an aimbot function that automaticlly hit the target, which I did without a hitch. This class showed that I retained the information that I had last class and showed that I could refactor code that I made myself.</p>



#### Sprite Batching/Drawing

<p>Sprite Batching/Drawing was in the same workshop as making the small game in C# but was a different ordeal in itself. I still don't understand how to exactly sprite batch but I have the general idea on the concept. Essentially it tought me how to import, and assign certain sprites to objects and variables as well as fonts! This impacted me because now I can add my own art assets to any C# project I want and I can futher customise a users experience. </p>



#### Khan: Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation

<p>This has been a module that I have been working on for a good while. I feel like I've gotten close to understanding and implementing object oriented design and the class code togethers have helped! JavaScript has been one of my best coding programs I've used and it's really been the guiding factor in building my interest for coding. This module has taught me the fundmentals of JS and what it can do.</p>



#### Codecamp: Basic JavaScript

<p>Freecodecamp's JavaScript package is a better alternative to Khans. It gives you a end goal then chops it up into neat and digestable parts that prod the user to go further. Although I didn't finish Codecamps basic JavaScript package because I felt burnt out of JS, I can apperciate the great start it give begineers and how well it convays the ins and outs of JS. When I do get back into JavaScript I will go for Code camps package any day due to the impact it made on me.</p>



#### Codecamp: Basic HTML and HTML5

<p>For Code camps Basic HTML course, I found it was deep and slow. I felt as it gave you one concept at a time then you immediatly mastered the command. It teaches you the very basics of HTML step by step. I don't exactly love HTML but this module made it bearable and made a impact on my stance of HTML.</p>



#### Codecamp: Basic CSS

<p>CSS was also a very well thought out course! It showed you the ropes while proding your designer thoughts. It makes learning HTML manageable and fun! It really changed my mindset about web development and it shows the amount of style you can put in one line of code!</p>



#### Course content: DanShiftman's Dinosaur Game

<p>The Dinosaur game was a really fun project! I enjoyed every moment learning everything I could from the video then transfering it to code. I added my own touches while staying true to the orginal concept. The dinosaur game is a web browser game that was created by google to help pass the time when you had no internet. It really changed my view of game design and showed me how fun it really is!</p>



#### MISC: Visual Studio

<p>Visual Studio is a launcher app that allows you to make all sorts of neat stuff like, crossplatform games, apps, libraries, ect... I used the monogame extention that allows me to use some prexisting shells for those I listed. It is a complicated launcher but it's powerful! I started using it because of the workshops I needed to do and visual studio was recommended to us. So I got learning and there is so much you can do! This has impacted me in the way of instead of trying to code everything myself, to maybe step back and use what's available without feeling like you cheated or your not doing the work yourself.</p>
