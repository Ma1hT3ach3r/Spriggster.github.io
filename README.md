## Welcome to my Portfolio! 
<p>Hello to whoever is looking at this site! I will be presenting what I have learned these passing months!</p>


### C-Sharp 1-4

<p> I've done quite a few C# WorkShops and I would like to share the best ones with you!</p>


#### Starting C#

<p>Starting C# was the first workshop I've ever done for coding outside of school! It brought me out of my comfort zone and dared me to <br>try new things! This was the gate way to C# and tought me the in's and out's of the langauge. All the basic variables and quirks of <br>the system. As well as what I would be dealing with as I carried on through the lessons. This also tought me to be independant with <br>my learning</p>
#### Working With Classes

<p>Working with classes was the 4th module and 4th workshop I worked through. It taught me about static, public and private <br>variables, in the context of a class. I also was taught how to affect the class within its self and from the main program. This was <br>a huge change because of setting static variables I could focus on objecto oriented design instead. This dramaticly increased my <br> interest in the workshop and has me looking forward to the next workshops comming up.</p>
#### Creating a small game in C#

<p>Creating a small game in C# was the 2nd workshop that I attended. It taught me about the all powerful void and those who dwell in it, <br>as well as if statements and loops. This was a exciting class that tested my ablities from the prior 1st workshop I did. I was 
<br>I was also tasked at the end of the class to create an aimbot function that automaticlly hit the target, which I did without a <br>hitch. This class showed that I retained the information that I had last class and showed that I could refactor code that I made <br>myself.</p>
#### Sprite Batching/Drawing

<p>Sprite Batching/Drawing was in the same workshop as making the small game in C# but was a different ordeal in itself. I still don't <br>understand fully how to Sprite Batch properly but it gave me the gist of the idea. </p>
